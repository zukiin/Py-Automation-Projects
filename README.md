# Py-Automation-Projects
A collection of some local python automation projects.

Projects for improving personal productivity.

## Project 1- Desktop cleaner:
Tracks file types in a specific directory and organizes them into another folder.

Background:
Besides files that one creates manually (and thus chooses where to store), when you download all types of files, they are typically stored in the Downloads folder, by default. Due to this, the downloads folder can get cluttered with different file types, and possibly even their outdated duplicates.

### Setting up
-- Requirements: Python3 and PIP
